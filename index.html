<h2><strong>NAME DROP KNOCKOUT</strong></h2>
<p><em>A Fast-Paced Game of Famous Fights & Alphabet Battles</em></p>
<hr>

<h3><strong>WHAT'S IN THE BOX:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>52 Letter Tiles (2 of each A–Z)</li>
  <li>1 Sand Timer (2-minute timer)</li>
  <li>1 Cloth Drawstring Tile Bag</li>
  <li>4 Pencils</li>
  <li>Scoring Pad</li>
  <li>QR Code to Digital Rulebook</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong></h3>
<p>Be the first to reach 15 points by thinking fast, naming famous people with randomly drawn initials, and debating whose pick would win in a prime-time fictional fistfight.</p>

<h3><strong>SETUP:</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Place all 52 tiles (2 of each letter A–Z) in the cloth bag.</li>
  <li>Give each player a pencil and a sheet of paper.</li>
  <li>Place the sand timer in reach.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:</strong></h3>
<p>Each round consists of drawing initials, quickly naming a person, resolving any challenges, writing names under a time limit, revealing and crossing out duplicates, choosing a champion, and debating a winner.</p>

<h3><strong>ROUND FLOW (2+ Players):</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>DRAW INITIALS:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Randomly draw 2 tiles from the bag.</li>
      <li>The <strong>first tile drawn</strong> is the <strong>first name initial</strong>.</li>
      <li>The <strong>second tile drawn</strong> is the <strong>last name initial</strong>.</li>
      <li>If the combo of initials is agreed to be too hard, redraw letters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>FIRST NAME CALL:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The first player to shout a valid person with those initials (real or fictional) gets <strong>+1 point</strong>.</li>
      <li>Example: If initials are T + O, someone might call out "Terrell Owens."</li>
      <li><strong>Any repeating names between players cancel out and do not count during scoring. Players cannot write down the first name yelled unless they were the one who yelled it.</strong></li>
      <li>If no name is yelled within 2 minutes, redraw initials, no points awarded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CHALLENGE PHASE (Optional):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If any player thinks the first name yelled is invalid, they may call "<strong>CHALLENGE!</strong>"</li>
      <li>Players then debate the validity of the name.</li>
      <li>If players disagree, have the challenger Google the name and ask: <strong>"What is their job/occupation, or what is one fact about them?"</strong></li>
      <li>If the challenger is successful (the name is invalid):
        <ul>
          <li>The challenger earns <strong>+1 point</strong>.</li>
          <li>The first name call does <strong>not</strong> count and the timer does not start.</li>
          <li><strong>The round ends immediately after the challenge resolution and new letters are drawn for the next round.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the challenger is unsuccessful:
        <ul>
          <li>The player who yelled the name earns <strong>+1 additional point</strong> (in addition to the initial point).</li>
          <li><strong>The round ends immediately after the challenge resolution and new letters are drawn for the next round.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>TIMER START (2 MINUTES):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>All players write down as many valid people as possible with the given initials.</li>
      <li>You may <strong>not write down the first name called unless you were the one who yelled it</strong>.</li>
      <li>No repeats from previous rounds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>REVEAL & CROSS OUT DUPLICATES:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Players reveal their lists.</li>
      <li>Any names that appear on more than one player’s list are crossed out and do not count.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CHAMPION SELECTION:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Each player picks <strong>one valid name</strong> from their remaining list to send into the fight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DEBATE PHASE:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Each player argues for <strong>2 minutes</strong> why their fighter would win.</li>
      <li>Then, each has <strong>2 minutes</strong> to rebut their opponent’s argument.</li>
      <li>Players assume all fighters are in their prime.</li>
      <li>If no debate is necessary, </strong>+1 Point to winner</strong><li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DECIDE WINNER:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In 2-player games:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If both players agree, the winner gets <strong>+1 point</strong>.</li>
          <li>If no agreement, the player who did <strong>not</strong> get the First Name Call may:
            <ul>
              <li>Call a third-party judge or AI, and the winner will get <strong>2 points</strong>.</li>
              <li>Or concede the debate point to the first-namer (worth only <strong>+1 point</strong> instead of 2).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>In 3+ player games:</strong> group votes to decide who wins the fight <em>(or if you can't decide you can always ask AI still)</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>BONUS POINT:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If only one player submitted any valid names, that player gets <strong>+1 bonus point</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>SCORE IT:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Record all points from the round.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>SCORING SUMMARY:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>+1: First to name a valid person.</li>
  <li>+1: Winner of the fight debate <em>(unless in 2-player scenario decided by AI, then +2 total points)</em>.</li>
  <li>+1: Bonus if the opponent didn’t write any names.</li>
  <li>+1: Successful challenge against invalid first name.</li>
</ul>

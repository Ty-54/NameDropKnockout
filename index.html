  <h1>NAME DROP KNOCKOUT</h1>
  <p><em>A Fast-Paced Game of Famous Fights & Alphabet Battles</em></p>
  <hr/>

  <h2>What’s in the Box:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>52 Letter Tiles (2 of each A–Z)</li>
    <li>1 Sand Timer (2-minute timer)</li>
    <li>1 Cloth Drawstring Tile Bag</li>
    <li>4 Pencils</li>
    <li>Scoring Pad</li>
    <li>QR Code to Digital Rulebook</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Objective:</h2>
  <p>Be the first to reach 15 points by thinking fast, naming famous people with randomly drawn initials, and debating whose pick would win in a prime-time fictional fistfight.</p>

  <h2>Setup:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place all 52 tiles (2 of each letter A–Z) in the cloth bag.</li>
    <li>Give each player a pencil and a sheet of paper.</li>
    <li>Place the sand timer in reach.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Gameplay Overview:</h2>
  <p>Each round consists of drawing initials, quickly naming a person, resolving any challenges, writing names under a time limit, revealing and crossing out duplicates, choosing a champion, and debating a winner.</p>

  <h2>Round Flow (2+ Players):</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>DRAW INITIALS:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Randomly draw 2 tiles from the bag.</li>
        <li>The first tile drawn is the first name initial.</li>
        <li>The second tile drawn is the last name initial.</li>
        <li>If the combo of initials is agreed to be too hard, redraw letters.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>FIRST NAME CALL:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The first player to shout a valid person with those initials (real or fictional) gets +1 point.</li>
        <li>Example: If initials are T + O, someone might call out "Terrell Owens."</li>
        <li>Any repeating names between players cancel out and do not count during scoring. Players cannot write down the first name yelled unless they were the one who yelled it.</li>
        <li>If no name is yelled within 2 minutes, redraw initials, no points awarded.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>CHALLENGE PHASE (Optional):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>If any player thinks the first name yelled is invalid, they may call “CHALLENGE!”</li>
        <li>Players then debate the validity of the name.</li>
        <li>If players disagree, have the challenger Google the name and ask: “What is their job/occupation, or what is one fact about them?”</li>
        <li>If the challenger is successful (the name is invalid):
          <ul>
            <li>The challenger earns +1 point.</li>
            <li>The first name call does not count and the timer does not start.</li>
            <li>The round ends immediately after the challenge resolution and new letters are drawn for the next round.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the challenger is unsuccessful:
          <ul>
            <li>The player who yelled the name earns +1 additional point (in addition to the initial point).</li>
            <li>The round ends immediately after the challenge resolution and new letters are drawn for the next round.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>TIMER START (2 MINUTES):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>All players write down as many valid people as possible with the given initials.</li>
        <li>You may not write down the first name called unless you were the one who yelled it.</li>
        <li>No repeats from previous rounds.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>REVEAL & CROSS OUT DUPLICATES:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Players reveal their lists.</li>
        <li>Any names that appear on more than one player’s list are crossed out and do not count.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>CHAMPION SELECTION:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player picks one valid name from their remaining list to send into the fight.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>DEBATE PHASE:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player argues for 2 minutes why their fighter would win.</li>
        <li>Then, each has 2 minutes to rebut their opponent’s argument.</li>
        <li>Players assume all fighters are in their prime.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>DECIDE WINNER:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>In 2-player games:
          <ul>
            <li>If both players agree, the winner gets +1 point.</li>
            <li>If no agreement, the player who did not get the First Name Call may:
              <ul>
                <li>Call a third-party judge or AI, and the winner will get 2 points.</li>
                <li>Or concede the debate point to the first-namer (worth only +1 point instead of 2).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In 3+ player games, group votes to decide who wins the fight (or if you can't decide you can always ask AI still).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>BONUS POINT:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>If only one player submitted any valid names, that player gets +1 bonus point.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>SCORE IT:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Record all points from the round.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Scoring Summary:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>+1: First to name a valid person.</li>
    <li>+1: Winner of the fight debate (unless in 2-player scenario decided by AI, then +2 total points).</li>
    <li>+1: Bonus if the opponent didn’t write any names.</li>
    <li>+1: Successful challenge against invalid first name.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Winning the Game:</h2>
  <p>First player to reach 15 points wins!</p>

  <h2>Round Examples:</h2>

  <h3>2-Player Example:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tiles Drawn: B + J</li>
    <li>Player 1 shouts: "Billy Joel" (+1 point)</li>
    <li>Timer starts.</li>
    <li>Player 1 writes: Billy Joel, Bob Johnson, Boris Johnson</li>
    <li>Player 2 writes: Betty Jones, Bruce Jenner</li>
    <li>Players reveal lists and cross out duplicates.</li>
    <li>Player 1 picks: Boris Johnson</li>
    <li>Player 2 picks: Bruce Jenner</li>
    <li>Debate happens.</li>
    <li>Group votes Bruce Jenner wins (+1 to Player 2)</li>
    <li>No bonus, as both submitted names.</li>
    <li>Player 1: 1 point</li>
    <li>Player 2: 1 point</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Round Flow Chart:</h2>
  <p>[DRAW INITIALS] → [FIRST VALID NAME CALLED? (CHALLENGE POSSIBLE)] → [CHALLENGE RESOLUTION (ROUND ENDS IF CHALLENGE)] → [START TIMER] → [WRITE NAMES] → [REVEAL & CROSS OUT DUPLICATES] → [SELECT FIGHTER] → [DEBATE] → [DECIDE WINNER] → [ASSIGN POINTS] → [SCOREPAD]</p>

  <h2>Additional Rules:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Anyone famous or Google-able is fair game.</li>
    <li>No made-up people or overly obscure names.</li>
    <li>You cannot use the same name more than once during the game.</li>
    <li>All fighters assumed to be in their prime.</li>
    <li>Players may agree to use a random genre filter (athletes only, villains only, etc.) for extra challenge.</li>
    <li>This is a fist fight — Clark Kent can't use his laser eyes, but if Bruce Banner wants to turn into The Hulk and throw someone across the globe, who's gonna stop him?</li>
    <li>Speaking of The Hulk, he isn't valid for T and H — and The Rock isn't valid for T and R.</li>
  </ul>
